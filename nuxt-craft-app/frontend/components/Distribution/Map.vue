                    <h3>Distribution that reaches nationwide</h3>
                    <h4>At Dreams, our distribution centres are much more than warehouses—they’re the beating heart of how we deliver restful sleep to customers across the UK. From the moment a bed leaves our facility, it’s on its way to becoming part of someone’s dream home.</h4>
                    <p>Our warehouses are fast-moving, collaborative environments that support a wide range of roles. From Warehouse Operatives who carefully pick, pack, and prepare customer orders, ensuring everything arrives in perfect condition, to Team Leaders and Managers who coordinate operations and keep everything running smoothly. Together, our warehouse teams make sure that every product is handled with care and efficiency, so customers can enjoy the comfort they deserve.</p>
